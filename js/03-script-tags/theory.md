# Intro to script tags

JavaScript is the language that powers web applications. Despite starting out as a browser-only scripting language, thanks to the introduction of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) it can now also be used for creating servers and even "desktop" or "native" applications.

For the purpose of this course, we are going to stick to the basics of JavaScript and mostly look at how it is used inside the browser.

The main way of loading JavaScript into a web page is through the use of script tags.
