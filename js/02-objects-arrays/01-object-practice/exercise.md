# Object practice

## Exercise 1

We have an object storing salaries of our team:

```javascript
let salaries = {
  John: 100,
  Ann: 160,
  Pete: 130,
};
```

Write the code to sum all salaries and store in the variable sum. Should be 390 in the example above.

If salaries is empty, then the result must be 0.

## Exercise 2

Create a function multiplyNumeric(obj) that multiplies all numeric property values of obj by 2.
